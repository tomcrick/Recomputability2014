\section{Introduction}

The reproduction and replication of reported scientific results is a 
topic of growing concern within the scientific community. Whilst
experimental work requires detailed protocol descriptions, computer
science and related disciplines uniquely are able to share the raw
outputs of their work- the software. 
Despite this advantage, there however remain cultural and technical 
barriers to both the sharing and reimplementation of 
algorithms~\cite{crick-et-al_wssspe2}. These include widely discussed
topics, such as choices of programming language and licence, as well
as unreported technical details of the implementations and ensuring 
that developers get credit for their work.

However, even when this is considered, the testing of the benchmarks
themselves may be non-trivial. Benchmarks may be tailored to the 
specific problems being addressed by the algorithm, and may not be 
expected to cover all edge cases. Implementation details, such as 
floating point rounding behaviour may change benchmark results.
Furthermore, for high performance computing applications, repeating
benchmark results may not be possible by other groups without equivalent
resources. Here we extend a previous proposal~\cite{crick-et-al_wssspe2}
to specifically discuss the role of benchmark sets and analysis.

\section{Implementation or model?}
