Title: Reproducibility-as-a-Service: Dream or reality?

Sections:

Introduction 
	Research data vs reproducible research
	Executable papers - Elsevier competition
	Digital Science efforts

Reproducibility as an 80% solution
	Do just enough
	cite Titus Brown's ladder

A research ecosystem for reproducibility
	Culture
		Enhance rather than complicate researcher's workflow
		Agreement and disagreement
	Generic versus discipline-specific requirements	
	Tools
		Consumer versus researcher
			Dropbox, Google Docs
		Existing
			Desktop - software
			Cloud - services
			Devices - apps

Making it work - Proof by induction
	Recomputation.org
	Codalab
	Seek4Me
	MyExperiment & Research Objects
	Benchmarks

Reproducibiltiy-as-a-Service
	Building blocks exist
	IaaS
		Recomputation.org
	PaaS
		Khymer protocols
		Try F#
		Github		
	SaaS - Collaboration tools
		Figshare
		Office 365 & Google Docs
	RaaS

Discussion
	RDA
	Science 2.0 EU Consultation

Conclusions
	Can we build a Reproducibility-as-a-Service ecosystem?
Is this the right approach?
