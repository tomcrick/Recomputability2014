@Inproceedings {Cook,
	abstract     = {<p>The stability of biological models is an important test for establishing their
		                soundness and accuracy. Stability in biological systems represents the ability of
					                a robust system to always return to homeostasis. In recent work, modular
							                approaches for proving stability have been

									                found to be swift and scalable. If stability is however not proved, the currently
											                available techniques apply an exhaustive search through the unstable state space
													                to find loops. This search is frequently prohibitively computationally expensive,
				                limiting its usefulness. Here we present a new modular approach eliminating the
							                need for an exhaustive search

									                for loops.  Using models of biological systems we show that the technique finds
												                loops significantly faster than brute force approaches. Furthermore, for a subset
															                of stable systems which are resistant to modular proofs, we observe a speed up of
																	                up to 3 orders of magnitude as the exhaustive searches for loops which cause
																			                instability are avoided. With our new procedure we are able to prove instability
																					                and stability in a number of

																							                realistic biological models, including adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis, the
																									                lambda phage lysogeny/lysis switch, voltage gated channel opening and cAMP
																											                oscillations in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. This new approach will
																													                support the development of new clinically relevant tools for industrial
																															                biomedicine.</p>},

   abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans vulval development is a paradigm system for understanding cell differentiation in the process of organogenesis. Through temporal and spatial controls, the fate pattern of six cells is determined by the competition of the LET-23 and the Notch signalling pathways. Modelling cell fate determination in vulval development using state-based models, coupled with formal analysis techniques, has been established as a powerful approach in predicting the outcome of combinations of mutations. However, computing the outcomes of complex and highly concurrent models can become prohibitive. Here, we show how logic programs derived from state machines describing the differentiation of C. elegans vulval precursor cells can increase the speed of prediction by four orders of magnitude relative to previous approaches. Moreover, this increase in speed allows us to infer, or ‘retrodict’, compatible genomes from cell fate patterns. We exploit this technique to predict highly variable cell fate patterns resulting from dig-1 reduced-function mutations and let-23 mosaics. In addition to the new insights offered, we propose our technique as a platform for aiding the design and analysis of experimental data.},
